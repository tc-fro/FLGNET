# FLGNET
Abstract:
Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) is a formidable computer vision challenge due to the striking resemblance between camouflaged objects and their surroundings, which renders identification an intractable task. In this paper, we introduce a pioneering multi-scale COD network, dubbed FLGNet, that leverages the synergistic fusion of local and global features. Our approach is distinguished by the incorporation of a Multi-Scale Fusion Module (MSFM), which meticulously integrates feature maps across various scales, layer by layer, to produce high-fidelity edge feature maps. To further refine the detection process, we employ a Local-Global Feature Fusion Module (LGFFM) that combines fine-grained local edge features with comprehensive global semantic information, significantly bolstering COD accuracy. The experiment results confirm the exceptional performance of FLGNet across the CAMO, COD10K, and NC4K datasets, particularly in scenarios featuring camouflaged objects against intricate backgrounds with high degrees of similarity.
